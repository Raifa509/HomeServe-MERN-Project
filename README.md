## 💡 Project Overview  
HomeServe is a **full‑stack home service platform** built with the MERN stack. It enables users to book regular and emergency services, connecting customers with service providers through a role‑based system (Customer / Service Provider / Admin). The platform features secure authentication, service listings, booking workflows, and an admin dashboard for real‑time monitoring and management.  

This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, secure, and user‑friendly full‑stack applications from scratch.
